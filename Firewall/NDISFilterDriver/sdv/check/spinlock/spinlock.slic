    Summary:
    Verify the correct usage of Spinlock DDIs.
    
    Description:
    The SpinLock rule verifies the correct use of the NDIS SpinLock interface. 
    This rule specifies that calls to NdisAcquireSpinLock are made only when the SpinLock is in the unlocked state. 
    This rule also verifies that the SpinLock is released before the miniport handler routine exits. 
    
    Related Rule:
    SpinLockDpr
